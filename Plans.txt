v0.7.5: Lev2 maps
 - Cathy Heck last ability
 j: Cars triggers (key, door locked, gas)
 k: Replace mocks with appropriately-named levels/maps
 l: Victory conditions for all levels
 m: Can access Minigames
 n: Can unlock mock minigame
 o: Notification for minigame unlock
 p: Notifications for hero/area unlocks
 q: Mock car broke down zombies minigame
 r: Generic Zombies spawn at night based on player level (11 - 100) => single ID unit
 s: Various zombie types (magic, ranged, etc.. have 10 for each and have series
   => so 21, 31, 41, etc. are all basic zombies but getting stronger)
 t: QA all levels

 - Design maps for Lev3s
 - Map outlines for Lev3s
 - Linkers for Lev3s
 - More crafting recipes (axes, tools for metalworking, hoe?, knife, bow, arrow, sling)
 - brothersdoor initial and boss fight triggers
 - ahimdoor initial and boss fight triggers
 - chapeldoor initial and boss fight triggers
 - Lev2-5: Custodialdoor map outlines
 - Triggers for Custodialdoor level
 - Finish all maps for all levels
 - Finish all triggers for all levels

 Pathfinding issues:
  - add random choose if multiple correct paths
  - if colliding need to move to center of current square
     => (maybe predict if collision will happen from start square, shouldn't be too hard)
  - targeted features above the walk height ignore pathfinding because is treated like you want to move to a wall
     => need to calculate pathfinding for every possibility (all sides and maybe corners) then return shortest
  - various other issues I can see when trying basic checks in map tester
  - update pathfinding whenever you have an any collision and it currently isn't running

  Options issues:
  - flag to turn off pathfinding for player unit
  - separate into sections on same form
  - make a TabbedForm extends Form element which is a form that displays a form based on tab selected

v0.7.6: Lev2/3 Levels
 - All triggers for Lev2/3 levels
v0.7.7: Autogeneration
 - Area is autogenerated, initially pretty limited size / complexity
v0.7.8: Zambos minigame ('road' map, very simple), maybe other minigames (lots of minigames), 'World Map'
v0.7.9: Beta prep => if have time maybe start making more heroes (or outlines of) or start automated map generation class
- Each door has natural progression to a final battle or some shit
  End level when you find a vehicle / can fuel it / can start it
- Level 3 has forest/golf course and that whole western part of Franciscan, includes a town minigame if you wander into town
  Town minigame isn't same as CoD town yet, that will be a future one I think
- Finish all parking lot items


 Fatal Bugs:
  -> java.lang.InternalError: Unrecognized PGCanvas token: 68
    => Also many other ClassCastExceptions
    => Happens often (~30%) in TutorialInterface
      -> remove something from a constructor somewhere ===> color() ??
      -> mostly just in reloading saved game
    => Going to perk tree then back to level fixes it???
    => Now happens much more rarely (~5%) so maybe now a replicate of below but related to TutorialInterface
  -> java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.sun.javafx.font.PrismFont cannot be cast to class com.sun.prism.paint.Paint (com.sun.javafx.font.PrismFont and com.sun.prism.paint.Paint are in module javafx.graphics of loader 'app')
    => Happens at 'opening file' step of testlevel
    => Also java.lang.InternalError: Unrecognized PGCanvas token: 68
    => Also many other ClassCastExceptions
    => Happens rarely (<5%) in MapEditorInterface no idea how to replicate
  MAYBE_FIX = remove textbox constructor from GameMap constructor (has color() and textSize() and textWidth() in it)
    => hasn't happened since (v0.6.9n)


Parking Lot:
 - Abilities need an arraylist of unit keys they've already hit for abilities like (103/108/1001)
 - Items have durability bars
 - Can clean guns mechanic
 - EASY COMPANY sound in tutorial
 - Constants to speed up trigger times / header message times (for testing purposes, maybe for in-game options too)
 - AchievementFormField, if not unlocked have flag (hidden) to determine if it will show (Have achievement groups)
 - Trigger editor has dropdownlist for effect id / condition id with name mappings
    => Also only show relevant fields and name them properly
 - Overhaul of DropDownList
 - PlayingTrack option in OptionsForm
 - Future items:
   => quiver, longbow, compound bow, crossbow, crossbow with explosives (from CoD)
   => magic wands and magic resist armor
 - molly schmiesing kidnapped by BOIZ so can rescue her (insert when making schmielet hero)
 - test/QA all guns, ray gun ammo / reload


v0.8: HomeBase and Campaign II
  -HomeBase is a 1-map Level that Ben starts in now (in Ohio)
    - In future have it auto-generated and much larger
    - Each campaign you complete unlocks the auto-generated map for that location (each is a different biome)
  -World Map / Vehicle from Campaign I used to travel to new Campaigns
  -Campaign II is Daniel Gray Campaign at Hopedale (FROGS, BROWN, EARTH)
   => Daniel locked himself in room to study chemistry / frogs
   => became frog during apocalypse
   => emerges and kills family
   => campaign is to reach yak ranch and get truck to drive to fernwood (where Ben is)
   => add seeds / plants / farming for this campaign
   => some kind of minigame with yaks ?
   => farm zambos map



 Far Parking Lot:
  - Finish PlayerLeftPanelForm (buttons to other forms to right of player image)
  - Create XpLeftPanelForm / other LeftPanelForms
  - Other TriangleButtons in InventoryBar
  - LoseFocus can turn off expensive visual calculations (and maybe pause game in SP)
  - Textbox that's editable
  - Make an installer??
  - Automated test for map readfile
  - When closing/opening panel while form is open need to update background image
  - Interrupting action stops action sound effect (don't assign curr_action have function that assigns it and in that if player silence appropriate sounds)
  - Visual effects for remaining status effects
  - Sound effects use directional information
  - Fridge/freezer/minifridge makes items cold
  - StoveInventory door image / burner images / knob functionality
  - Stove/fire makes items hot
  - All Ben unit sounds
  - All Dan unit sounds
  - Weapon attachments (use item inventory)
  - Terrain/features have absorption/transmittance/reflectance of light
    => reflectance relevant for lasers/ray gun



v0.9: Campaign III / IV / V
- Campaign III is Patrick Rolwes campaign in St Louis (???, ???)
  one ability is streaking which increases move speed and makes him ??
- Campaign IV is JF Ellis campaign in North Dakota (BOIZ, CYAN, ICE)
- Campaign V is Mike Mattus campaign in Atlanta (Confederates, MAGENTA, NUCLEAR)



To make tint work on FX2D:

PowerShell commands:
Get lines of all pde files in directory:
  >> Get-content '*.pde' | Measure-Object â€“Line
Rename all images in folder:
  >> ls | %{Rename-Item $_ -NewName ("{0}.png" -f $nr++)}
Get number of image (png) files:

  Other campaign ideas:
   - Zombie campaign to kill Hillary Clinton and unlock Donald Trump hero
   - Spinny campaign at Rome (VATICAN, RED, FIRE)
   - Ethan campaign at ??? (AIRFORCE, ORANGE, AIR)
   - Connor Giddens campaign at ??? (MAGIC??, YELLOW, ELECTRIC)
   - Mike Hanlon campaign at ??? (USGOV, ???, ???)
   - Connor Smith campaign at ??? (BLUE, SEALS, WATER)
   - (SPACEFORCE, PURPLE, GRAVITY)



  Future Ideas:
   - Many more single-player campaigns each that have minigame, unlock hero, some new theme or color
   - Campaigns have a difficulty tier (1, 2, 3, etc) and can only go for a tier 2 once 2 tier 1s complete, etc,
   - Zombie campaign is say tier 3 and once it's complete you destroy the multiverse device and unlock multiplayer content
   - You then port all info into server to begin multiplayer content
   - World map then split into areas (longitude/latitude) and stored on server
   - You can raise armies, make alliances, conquer areas
   - Areas are squares with 5 sub-areas: western front, eastern front, northern front, southern front, center
   - The fronts are just battlegrounds where you can't do anything but fight with armies
   - All 5 areas have a Level (set of maps) associated with it and autogenerated
   - Roads/airports in/through areas as in real world
   - Can build things in sub-areas like a blockade to prevent enemies from using road, or a taxing service in center to tax citizens
   - Areas have a population, etc
   - Armies have morale

  Future 'Update' Ideas:
    - Crafting Update, workbench, gray
    - Geology Update, ores, can dig, brown
    - Chemistry Update, extensive chemistry, magenta
    - Nether Update, nether (same for each area? large autogenerated with some spawn for each area), red
    - Ocean Update, boat vehicles, swimming, blue
