v0.7.8: World Map (07/23)
 r: In WorldMap display current hero (from profile) in left panel (bottom) and (maybe) even display inventory bar

 t: Can unlock minigame in PlayingInterface
 u: Can't finish campaign without finishing a minigame (or getting to certain point in minigame)
 v: Ben Nelson campaign name, description
 w: Can't finish Ben Nelson campaign without car break down minigame
 x: WorldMap circles can see which ones are unlocked / what to do to unlock in LeftPanelForm
 y: Apply magnetic_hands logic

  Minigames:
   - Campaigns can unlock minigames (completion code or in future trigger)
   - Campaigns can "force" you to play if you haven't previously unlocked minigame
   - Shatranj minigame
   - Zambo minigame: car broke down map
   - Zambo minigame: farm copy map (Dan Gray campaign)

  Ben Nelson Campaign:
   - brothersdoor initial and boss fight triggers
   - chapeldoor initial and boss fight triggers

   - Finish frontdoor forcing you to get access to a car
     => Finish map outlines
     => Can get car in lev3 (field boss?)
     => Add items to frontdoor maps

  ElementLibrary:
   - SliderFormField should display current value
   - Textbox that's editable
   - Overhaul of DropDownList

  GameMapArea:
   - Fix GameMapArea terrain image having lines on chunk borders (could be resize, but more likely can be fixed at GameMapArea DImg thread)
   - Weird fog bug when at negative numbers (maybe stay at mostly positive numbers ??)
   - Fog flickers when testing GameMapArea
   - WARNING: Can't find chunk with coordinates to add feature to (actuallyAddFeature) => put in another hanging list I guess ?
   - Bug when removing then readding chunk features hanging onto that chunk not loaded again
     => when removing chunk check chunks left and up (all 3 possibilities) and add to hanging lists
   - Bug where there's race condition between thread saving to temp folder and deleting temp folder
   - Make trees spawn a little more spread out
   - Can't hover features in area until moving near them ???
   - Need road / parking lot chunk in initial Fernwood map
   - Items/Units despawn in Areas and with time/distance, respectively
   - Fernwood forest has:
      => broken down cars (can go in car inventory -> separate thingy mcjigger?)
      => park rangers / park ranger buildings
      => hiker campground with hiker, tent, campfire, etc.
      => wildlife => turkey, quail, deer, bear, fish, raccoon, squirrel, bees

  Sounds:
   - Title IX charge sound effects
   - EASY COMPANY sound in tutorial
   - Every perk has unique sound effect
   - Sound effects use directional information
   - All Ben unit sounds
   - All Dan unit sounds
   - Interrupting action stops action sound effect
       =>don't assign curr_action have function that assigns it silences appropriate sound(s)

  Pathfinding issues:
   - targeted features above the walk height ignore pathfinding because is treated like you want to move to a wall
      => need to calculate pathfinding for every possibility (all sides and maybe corners) then return shortest
   - various other issues I can see when trying basic checks in map tester

  Menues:
   - Flag to turn off pathfinding for player unit
   - PlayingTrack option
   - Stats for player class (tab in Achievement form)
   - Add continuous achievements (walk x distance, gain x xp, kill x units)
   - Notifications need to automatically go to next line if string too long
   - Trigger editor has dropdownlist for effect id / condition id with name mappings
      => Also only show relevant fields and name them properly
   - When closing/opening panel while form is open need to update background image
   - Have option to toggle "minecraft-like" inventory

  Fatal Bugs:
   - Memory leak in GameMapArea (probably with images) causes crash eventually
   - DImg.pde:10:0:10:0: NegativeArraySizeException: -1900331964 (in GameMapArea when adding hero I believe)


v0.7.9: Beta prep => if have time maybe start making more heroes (or outlines of) (08/06)

  Parking Lot:

   - Fishing mechanics => not just fish that are spawned
   - Extend / QA crafting recipes and mechanics
   - Items have durability bars
   - Clean guns mechanics (or jams and have to unjam, eventually can't shoot)
   - Add ticks to healthbars (every 100? 50? depends on level of current hero? depends on level?)
   - Constants to speed up trigger times / header message times (for testing purposes, maybe for in-game options too)
   - Future items:
     => quiver, longbow, compound bow, crossbow, crossbow with explosives (from CoD)
     => magic wands and magic resist armor
   - molly schmiesing kidnapped by BOIZ so can rescue her (insert when making schmielet hero)

   - Hero wallet (arraylist of integers where index is what kind of money):
     => accompanying PlayerLeftPanelForm showing breakdown of what's inside
     => can take money in and out of wallet
     => wallet displays current (integer) money amount
     => ATM feature to drop money from wallet to player bank account and vice versa
     => some things return change (like Khalil), some don't (like vending machine)

  Chess:
   - v0.7.6y: ~2-3 nodes / s, depth = 1
     => Need to create all daughters lazily after evaluations for that depth are complete
     => Need to determine rate-limiting step (hunch is initializing board)

To make tint work on FX2D:
g.removeCache()


- 1681075482 is brown with transparency of 100


PowerShell commands:
Get lines of all pde files in directory:
  >> Get-content '*.pde' | Measure-Object â€“Line
Rename all images in folder:
  >> ls | %{Rename-Item $_ -NewName ("{0}.png" -f $nr++)}

Other campaign ideas:
 - Zombie campaign to kill Hillary Clinton and unlock Donald Trump hero
 - Ethan campaign at ??? (AIRFORCE, ORANGE, AIR) or maybe spaceforce...

 - Connor Smith campaign at ??? (BLUE, SEALS, WATER)
 - (SPACEFORCE, PURPLE, GRAVITY)

Other Hero ideas (non-campaign heroes)
 - 1-3 at each flagship campaign
 - Schmielet (from mike / molly schmiesing)
 - Various zombies you can heal (Duggy, Cathy Heck)
 - Dom Quinn (minicampaign?)
 - Some handmaids (like the fat one was cool) or other girls like Olivia/Clair
 - Mike Fischer when you get your eyes back (when / where) after fighting him in a boss battle
 - Dr. Dan Kempton (maybe a campaign at his property or just a minicampaign)
 - Donald Trump of course



  Future Ideas:
   - Many more single-player campaigns each that have minigame, unlock hero, some new theme or color
   - Campaigns have a difficulty tier (1, 2, 3, etc) and can only go for a tier 2 once 2 tier 1s complete, etc,
   - Zombie campaign is say tier 3 and once it's complete you destroy the multiverse device and unlock multiplayer content
   - You then port all info into server to begin multiplayer content
   - World map then split into areas (longitude/latitude) and stored on server
   - You can raise armies, make alliances, conquer areas
   - Areas are squares with 5 sub-areas: western front, eastern front, northern front, southern front, center
   - The fronts are just battlegrounds where you can't do anything but fight with armies
   - All 5 areas have a Level (set of maps) associated with it and autogenerated
   - Roads/airports in/through areas as in real world
   - Can build things in sub-areas like a blockade to prevent enemies from using road, or a taxing service in center to tax citizens
   - Areas have a population, etc
   - Armies have morale

  Future 'Update' Ideas:
    - Crafting Update, workbench, gray
    - Geology Update, ores, can dig, brown
    - Chemistry Update, extensive chemistry, magenta
    - Nether Update, nether (same for each area? large autogenerated with some spawn for each area), red
    - Ocean Update, boat vehicles, swimming, blue
    - Business Update, economics, control towns/cities
    - Narnia Update, wardrobe, cyan
    - Clouds Update, flying vehicles/units, dragon, orange
    - Electricity Update, circuits, yellow
    - Interstellar Update, space travel/battles, purple

Legacy Future Ideas
 - Various minigames throughout that are then unlocked (Zambos, chess, etc)
 - Dimensions / intersections lore
 - At some point get home base (empire)
- Still some levels to complete here as missions
- Also other gameplay with consistent income of money / materials
- Wage war against other empires on Earth / conquer earth
- Last boss is Hillary Clinton lizard zombie (from another dimension)
 - Once you conquer / save Earth and drive out lizards you take the fight to them
- Multiplayer aspect now since every player is another version of Earth
- Need servers ...
- Still levels that can be unlocked / completed
- Arena to fight other players
- Co-op against lizards
- Raise level limit ?
  - Pan as melee weapon when rapunzel has it she is uber powerful
- other weapons that are extra powerful with certain characters
  - in lieu of having scroll inventories I decided to instead once you have a home base you can build various buildings including a vault that you then can build an indefinite number of chests in (which are named and show up in a listtextbox)



TESTING:
 - Some kind of automated testing (unit tests)
 - Add testing interface / TESTING state
 - Can manually put in testing state for testing
 - Testing interface is done from the console using number keys to make choices
- Initially just have '1' be test all and have no other options
 - Level Tests
- Can make level in each way (constructor)
- Can read level from level file
- Can save level to level file (ensure file integrity)
- Can open map in level
 - GameMap Tests
- ReadFile integrity
 - Player Tests
- ReadFile integrity
 - Damage Tests
- Run in loop
- Each damage type (none, physical, magic, mixed, true)
- Each damage color (none, elementless, blue, red, cyan, orange, brown, purple, etc.)
- Several attack/magic options (-10, 0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 20, 100, 1000)
- Several attack/magic ratios (-1, 0, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2, 10)
- Defense / Resistance (-10, 0, 10, 100)
- Piercing / penetration (
- projectiles ?
