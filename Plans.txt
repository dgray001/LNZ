v0.7.7: Ben Nelson Campaign (07/09)
 - Base Fernwood map
 - Have campaign name / etc. => better displays in playinginterface
 - Make World map with all 6 initial heroes (Ben, Dan, Mattus, Patrick, JF, Spinny)
 - Finish all Lev2s/Lev3s for at least ahimdoor/brothersdoor, maybe chapeldoor

 - Need to somehow deal with features overlapping chunks
 - Fix GameMapArea terrain image having lines on chunk borders (could be resize, but more likely can be fixed at GameMapArea DImg thread)

 - Finish frontdoor forcing you to get access to a car
   => Finish map outlines
   => Can get car in lev3 (field boss?)
   => Add items to frontdoor maps
 - Make car broke down minigame
 - Initial autogenerated Fernwood map (simple terrain, some trees/bushes)
    => only autogenerated in 3 directions since need a parking lot / road into a map edge

  - Finish maps for Lev3s
  - Lot boss drops key for car in lot
  - Linkers for Lev3s
  - More crafting recipes (axes, tools for metalworking, hoe?, knife, bow, arrows, sling, slingshot)
  - brothersdoor initial and boss fight triggers
  - ahimdoor initial and boss fight triggers
  - chapeldoor initial and boss fight triggers
  - Lev2-5: Custodialdoor map outlines
  - Triggers for Custodialdoor level
  - Finish all maps for all levels
  - Finish all triggers for all levels
  - Other generic zombies (various abilities)
  - Add magic zombie, ranged zombie (uses sight)
  - Ensure level progression is correct
  - Ensure all maps have correct map codes
  - Title IX charge sound effects
  - Mock car broke down minigame unlocked when ahimdoor car started
  - Add items into frontdoor maps
  - Items/Units never unspawn on normal GameMap, only on Areas and only with distance/time
  - Can access unlocked minigames, create mock minigame (use zambos)
  - Campaigns can unlock minigames (completion code or in future trigger), "force" you to play if you haven't previously unlocked it

  Pathfinding issues:
   - targeted features above the walk height ignore pathfinding because is treated like you want to move to a wall
      => need to calculate pathfinding for every possibility (all sides and maybe corners) then return shortest
   - various other issues I can see when trying basic checks in map tester

   Options issues:
   - flag to turn off pathfinding for player unit
   - separate into sections on same form
   - make a TabbedForm extends Form element which is a form that displays a form based on tab selected
   - PlayingTrack option

   Chess Notes:
    - v0.7.6y: ~2-3 nodes / s, depth = 1
       => Need to create all daughters lazily after evaluations for that depth are complete
       => Need to determine rate-limiting step (hunch is initializing board)
       => Some basic pruning once rest of what I can do is done
    - Not sure if evaluations passed up the tree properly (need to have depth > 1 to know)
    - Can hold next/prev buttons to go through many times
    - Can drag-drop to move
    - Time controls
    - Computer think time based on time controls
    - End games are annotated (out of time, insufficient material)
    - Can save / load chess games (.chess.lnz file)
    - Multiple color / piece schemes switchable in an options button (left panel?)

v0.7.8: ??? (07/23)
 - Finish custodialdoor
 - QA all content so far
 - Make descriptions for all heroes, add others into heroesform

v0.7.9: Beta prep => if have time maybe start making more heroes (or outlines of) (08/06)
 - Finish all parking lot items, fatal bugs
 - Extend / QA crafting recipes and mechanics
 - Have autogenerated terrain make more realistic terrain melding


 Fatal Bugs:
  -> java.lang.InternalError: Unrecognized PGCanvas token: 68
    => Also many other ClassCastExceptions
    => Happens often (~30%) in TutorialInterface
      -> remove something from a constructor somewhere ===> color() ??
      -> mostly just in reloading saved game
    => Going to perk tree then back to level fixes it???
    => Now happens much more rarely (~5%) so maybe now a replicate of below but related to TutorialInterface
  -> java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.sun.javafx.font.PrismFont cannot be cast to class com.sun.prism.paint.Paint (com.sun.javafx.font.PrismFont and com.sun.prism.paint.Paint are in module javafx.graphics of loader 'app')
    => Happens at 'opening file' step of testlevel
    => Also java.lang.InternalError: Unrecognized PGCanvas token: 68
    => Also many other ClassCastExceptions
    => Happens rarely (<5%) in MapEditorInterface no idea how to replicate
  MAYBE_FIX = remove textbox constructor from GameMap constructor (has color() and textSize() and textWidth() in it)
    => hasn't happened since (v0.6.9n)
  MAYBE_FIX = removed all uses of color(), etc and replaced with my ccolor()


Parking Lot:
 - Player Perk tree, various achievements
 - Mining mechanics
 - Farming mechanics
 - Trapping mechanics
 - Areas can have feature overflow
 - Fishing mechanics
 - Items have durability bars
 - Can clean guns mechanic
 - Add ticks to healthbars (every 100? 50? depends on level of hero? depends on level?)
 - EASY COMPANY sound in tutorial
 - Constants to speed up trigger times / header message times (for testing purposes, maybe for in-game options too)
 - AchievementFormField, if not unlocked have flag (hidden) to determine if it will show (Have achievement groups)
 - Trigger editor has dropdownlist for effect id / condition id with name mappings
    => Also only show relevant fields and name them properly
 - Overhaul of DropDownList
 - Future items:
   => quiver, longbow, compound bow, crossbow, crossbow with explosives (from CoD)
   => magic wands and magic resist armor
 - molly schmiesing kidnapped by BOIZ so can rescue her (insert when making schmielet hero)
 - test/QA all guns, ray gun ammo / reload

v0.8: Campaigns II / III (09/30)
  -World Map / Vehicle from Campaign I used to travel to new Campaigns
  -Campaign II is Daniel Gray Campaign at Hopedale (FROGS, BROWN, EARTH)
   => Daniel locked himself in room to study chemistry / frogs
   => became frog during apocalypse
   => emerges and kills family
   => campaign is to reach yak ranch and get truck to drive to fernwood (where Ben is)
   => add seeds / plants / farming for this campaign
   => some kind of minigame with yaks ?
   => farm zambos map
 - Campaign III is Patrick Rolwes campaign in St Louis (???, ???)
   one ability is streaking which increases move speed and makes him ??
   biome is less trees and more open (horses that you can ride)
 - Traveling between levels with cars (trunk of car is large inventory)



 Far Parking Lot:
  - Finish PlayerLeftPanelForm (buttons to other forms to right of player image)
  - Create XpLeftPanelForm / other LeftPanelForms
  - Other TriangleButtons in InventoryBar
  - LoseFocus can turn off expensive visual calculations (and maybe pause game in SP)
  - Textbox that's editable
  - Make an installer
  - Automated test for map readfile
  - When closing/opening panel while form is open need to update background image
  - Interrupting action stops action sound effect (don't assign curr_action have function that assigns it and in that if player silence appropriate sounds)
  - Visual effects for remaining status effects
  - Sound effects use directional information
  - Fridge/freezer/minifridge makes items cold
  - StoveInventory door image / burner images / knob functionality
  - Stove/fire makes items hot
  - All Ben unit sounds
  - All Dan unit sounds
  - Weapon attachments (use item inventory)
  - Terrain/features have absorption/transmittance/reflectance of light
    => reflectance relevant for lasers/ray gun

To make tint work on FX2D:
g.removeCache()


- 1681075482 is brown with transparency of 100


PowerShell commands:
Get lines of all pde files in directory:
  >> Get-content '*.pde' | Measure-Object â€“Line
Rename all images in folder:
  >> ls | %{Rename-Item $_ -NewName ("{0}.png" -f $nr++)}
Get number of image (png) files:
  >> Get-ChildItem -Path './data/images/' -recurse -include '*.png' | Measure-Object -line



Other campaign ideas:
 - Zombie campaign to kill Hillary Clinton and unlock Donald Trump hero
 - Ethan campaign at ??? (AIRFORCE, ORANGE, AIR) or maybe spaceforce...
 - Connor Giddens campaign at ??? (MAGIC??, YELLOW, ELECTRIC)
 - Mike Hanlon campaign at ??? (USGOV, ???, ???)
 - Connor Smith campaign at ??? (BLUE, SEALS, WATER)
 - (SPACEFORCE, PURPLE, GRAVITY)
 - Dan Johnson ???
 - Kilgore ???
 - Noah Belemjian ???
 - Dave the coat guy ???


Other Hero ideas (non-campaign heroes)
 - 1-3 at each flagship campaign
 - Schmielet (from mike / molly schmiesing)
 - Various zombies you can heal (Duggy, Cathy Heck)
 - Dom Quinn (minicampaign?)
 - Some handmaids (like the fat one was cool) or other girls like Olivia/Clair
 - Mike Fischer when you get your eyes back (when / where) after fighting him in a boss battle
 - Dr. Dan Kempton (maybe a campaign at his property or just a minicampaign)
 - Donald Trump of course



  Future Ideas:
   - Many more single-player campaigns each that have minigame, unlock hero, some new theme or color
   - Campaigns have a difficulty tier (1, 2, 3, etc) and can only go for a tier 2 once 2 tier 1s complete, etc,
   - Zombie campaign is say tier 3 and once it's complete you destroy the multiverse device and unlock multiplayer content
   - You then port all info into server to begin multiplayer content
   - World map then split into areas (longitude/latitude) and stored on server
   - You can raise armies, make alliances, conquer areas
   - Areas are squares with 5 sub-areas: western front, eastern front, northern front, southern front, center
   - The fronts are just battlegrounds where you can't do anything but fight with armies
   - All 5 areas have a Level (set of maps) associated with it and autogenerated
   - Roads/airports in/through areas as in real world
   - Can build things in sub-areas like a blockade to prevent enemies from using road, or a taxing service in center to tax citizens
   - Areas have a population, etc
   - Armies have morale

  Future 'Update' Ideas:
    - Crafting Update, workbench, gray
    - Geology Update, ores, can dig, brown
    - Chemistry Update, extensive chemistry, magenta
    - Nether Update, nether (same for each area? large autogenerated with some spawn for each area), red
    - Ocean Update, boat vehicles, swimming, blue
    - Business Update, economics, control towns/cities
    - Narnia Update, wardrobe, cyan
    - Clouds Update, flying vehicles/units, dragon, orange
    - Electricity Update, circuits, yellow
    - Interstellar Update, space travel/battles, purple

Legacy Future Ideas

 - At some point get home base (empire)
- Still some levels to complete here as missions
- Also other gameplay with consistent income of money / materials
- Wage war against other empires on Earth / conquer earth
- Last boss is Hillary Clinton lizard zombie (from another dimension)
 - Once you conquer / save Earth and drive out lizards you take the fight to them
- Multiplayer aspect now since every player is another version of Earth
- Need servers ...
- Still levels that can be unlocked / completed
- Arena to fight other players
- Co-op against lizards
- Raise level limit ?
  - Pan as melee weapon when rapunzel has it she is uber powerful
- other weapons that are extra powerful with certain characters
  - in lieu of having scroll inventories I decided to instead once you have a home base you can build various buildings including a vault that you then can build an indefinite number of chests in (which are named and show up in a listtextbox)



TESTING:
