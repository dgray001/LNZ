   *Tutorial notes:
     - Attack enemy (John Rankin) => he's yelling easy company
     - Open inventory and get key
     - Unlock door
     - Get knife from desk
     - Pickup item (knife) then stab John Rankin (he runs away)
       - Easter egg is if you can kill John Rankin he drops "The Third Ball"
       - Killing John Rankin is an Achievement
       - Done by body-blocking his escape route
         - When he is damaged he will cry "You broke my glasses" and start running away
         - He will also activate a "rage" ability to make himself invulnerable for 3s or smth
       - Since he is blocking hallway you have to go over him
         - Wait for chicken to lay egg, then kill it, hatch egg to make another chicken (height 2)
         - Use chicken to jump on water fountain (height 4), then onto Rankin (height 6)
     - Use item => consumable (food), money, throwable (pebble), ranged weapon (slingshot)
     - Put everything back in desk/ground/whatever (doesn't force you to remove "The Third Ball")
     - Sleep to reset spawn point (dropped items disappear when you sleep, manually make desk items disappear)
     - Dream of lava in hallway => die and respawn at bed
     - Experience gained / unlock abilities
       - Forced to unlock Ben's ultimate ability
     - Use ultimate to cross lava
       - A previously locked door is now unlocked which has an ender chest in it
       - Place "The Third Ball" in the ender chest to have it for later
       - Finding this chest is also an Achievement
     - Finish level by entering common room (just another evening in the life of Ben Nelson)

Bugs:
 - In OptionsForm the 'apply' and 'defaults' buttons don't work although they used to...
 - Profile button in main menu has fucked up ripple (circle too small and has rect)
 - In TriggerEditor the effect name doesn't show up until you click it
 - Remove colors from edge of map images
 - Pressing exit plays next song in track
 - InputBox is fucking bugged

v0.7.2: Campaign I Prep
 - PlayingInterface outline
 - Levels save in a levels/level_location folder
 - When trying to start a level with a hero first check if another hero is currently in that level
 - Finish tutorial, including easter eggs
 - Fix all outstanding bugs
 - Creating profile should create a Ben Nelson hero located in Francis Hall campaign
 - When pressing play game if only 1 hero auto go to that one, else display hero form to choose
v0.7.3: Francis Hall maps
v0.7.4: Francis Hall triggers
v0.7.5: Lev2 maps
v0.7.6: Lev2 triggers
v0.7.7: Lev3 maps
v0.7.8: Lev3 triggers
-Remake Francis Hall maps (with terrain instead of features everywhere)
-Each door has natural progression to a final battle or some shit
  End level when you find a vehicle / can fuel it / can start it
-Each door has same level 2/maps but different start locations, and is difficult to reach other paths
-Level 3 has forest/golf course and that whole western part of Franciscan, includes a town minigame if you wander into town
  Town minigame isn't same as CoD town yet, that will be a future one I think


 Sounds to Add:
  - All Ben unit sounds
  - All Dan unit sounds


 Fatal Bugs:
  -> java.lang.InternalError: Unrecognized PGCanvas token: 68
    => Also many other ClassCastExceptions
    => Happens often (~30%) in TutorialInterface
      -> remove something from a constructor somewhere ===> color() ??
    => Going to perk tree then back to level fixes it???
  -> java.lang.ClassCastException: class com.sun.javafx.font.PrismFont cannot be cast to class com.sun.prism.paint.Paint (com.sun.javafx.font.PrismFont and com.sun.prism.paint.Paint are in module javafx.graphics of loader 'app')
    => Happens at 'opening file' step of testlevel
    => Also java.lang.InternalError: Unrecognized PGCanvas token: 68
    => Also many other ClassCastExceptions
    => Happens rarely (<5%) no idea how to replicate
  MAYBE_FIX = remove textbox constructor from GameMap constructor (has color() and textSize() and textWidth() in it)
    => hasn't happened since (v0.6.9n)


Parking Lot:
 - Finish PlayerLeftPanelForm (buttons to other forms to right of player image)
 - Create XpLeftPanelForm / other LeftPanelForms
 - Other TriangleButtons in InventoryBar
 - Now that we have Unit::map_key remove all the useless int myKey arguments in Unit (and maybe elsewehere?)
 - Make Features an arraylist since they can be removed and add Feature::map_key
 - Same with VisualEffects and Projectiles
 - Status effect descriptions use Constants
 - DeskInventory drawer images
 - StoveInventory door image / burner images / knob functionality
 - TrashInventories only display what's on top, items 'fall' down trash can
 - Achievements form has button to PlayerTree and vice/versa
 - Double click quests to open QuestForm
 - Add condition/effect selector (dropdownlist instead of typing id)

Far Parking Lot:
 - LoseFocus can turn off expensive visual calculations (and maybe pause game in SP)
 - Textbox that's editable
 - Make an installer??
 - Automated test for map readfile
 - When closing/opening panel while form is open need to update background image
 - Interrupting action stops action sound effect (don't assign curr_action have function that assigns it and in that if player silence appropriate sounds)
 - Visual effects for remaining status effects
 - Sound effects use directional information
 - Fridge/freezer/minifridge makes items cold
 - Stove/fire makes items hot


v0.8: HomeBase and Campaign II
  -HomeBase is a 1-map Level that Ben starts in now (in Ohio)
    - At first have it small
    - In future have it auto-generated and much larger
    - Biome depends on location
    - Each campaign you complete unlocks the auto-generated map for that location (each is a different biome)
  -World Map / Vehicle from Campaign I used to travel to new Campaigns
  -Campaign II is Daniel Gray Campaign at Hopedale (FROGS, BROWN, EARTH)
  -Can always go back to old campaigns
  -When going back to FrancisHall campaign won't start
  -Can switch between Heroes (Ben doing one Campaign, Daniel at HomeBase, etc..)


v0.9: Campaign III / IV / V
- Campaign III is Patrick Rolwes campaign in St Louis (???, ???)
  one ability is streaking which increases move speed and makes him
- Campaign IV is JF Ellis campaign in North Dakota (BOIZ, CYAN, ICE)
- Campaign V is Mike Mattus campaign in Atlanta (Confederates, MAGENTA, NUCLEAR)





Other campaign ideas:
 - Zombie campaign to kill Hillary Clinton and unlock Donald Trump hero
 - Spinny campaign at Rome (VATICAN, RED, FIRE)
 - Ethan campaign at ??? (AIRFORCE, ORANGE, AIR)
 - Connor Giddens campaign at ??? (MAGIC??, YELLOW, ELECTRIC)
 - Mike Hanlon campaign at ??? (USGOV, ???, ???)
 - Connor Smith campaign at ??? (BLUE, SEALS, WATER)
 - (SPACEFORCE, PURPLE, GRAVITY)



Future Ideas:
 - Many more single-player campaigns each that have minigame, unlock hero, some new theme or color
 - Campaigns have a difficulty tier (1, 2, 3, etc) and can only go for a tier 2 once 2 tier 1s complete, etc,
 - Zombie campaign is say tier 3 and once it's complete you destroy the multiverse device and unlock multiplayer content
 - You then port all info into server to begin multiplayer content
 - World map then split into areas (longitude/latitude) and stored on server
 - You can raise armies, make alliances, conquer areas
 - Areas are squares with 5 sub-areas: western front, eastern front, northern front, southern front, center
 - The fronts are just battlegrounds where you can't do anything but fight with armies
 - All 5 areas have a Level (set of maps) associated with it and autogenerated
 - Roads/airports in/through areas as in real world
 - Can build things in sub-areas like a blockade to prevent enemies from using road, or a taxing service in center to tax citizens
 - Areas have a population, etc
 - Armies have morale

Future 'Update' Ideas:
  - Crafting Update, workbench, gray
  - Geology Update, ores, can dig, brown
  - Chemistry Update, extensive chemistry, magenta
  - Nether Update, nether (one for each homebase?), red
  - Ocean Update, boat vehicles, swimming, blue
  - Business Update, economics, control towns/cities
  - Narnia Update, wardrobe, cyan
  - Clouds Update, flying vehicles/units, dragon, orange
  - Electricity Update, circuits, yellow
  - Interstellar Update, space travel/battles, purple



To make tint work on FX2D:
g.removeCache()




PowerShell commands:
Get lines of all pde files in directory:
  >> Get-content '*.pde' | Measure-Object â€“Line
Rename all images in folder:
  >> ls | %{Rename-Item $_ -NewName ("{0}.png" -f $nr++)}
Get number of image (png) files:
  >> Get-ChildItem -Path './data/images/' -recurse -include '*.png' | Measure-Object -line

Ideas on hold until future update

???, ??? orange (air) / ???

 - Various minigames throughout that are then unlocked (Zambos, chess, etc)
 - Dimensions / intersections lore
 - At some point get home base (empire)
- Still some levels to complete here as missions
- Also other gameplay with consistent income of money / materials
- Wage war against other empires on Earth / conquer earth
- Last boss is Hillary Clinton lizard zombie (from another dimension)
 - Once you conquer / save Earth and drive out lizards you take the fight to them
- Multiplayer aspect now since every player is another version of Earth
- Need servers ...
- Still levels that can be unlocked / completed
- Arena to fight other players
- Co-op against lizards
- Raise level limit ?
  - Pan as melee weapon when rapunzel has it she is uber powerful
- other weapons that are extra powerful with certain characters
  - in lieu of having scroll inventories I decided to instead once you have a home base you can build various buildings including a vault that you then can build an indefinite number of chests in (which are named and show up in a listtextbox)
